<div style="font-size: 35px">Why did I choose coala as the organization?</div>

I planned to choose Zulip this year. But I couldn't find the organization in GCI 2018's organization list. <br>
So I scrolled down the organizations list, looking for one with the python tag.

There were a lot of organizations that uses python, but coala seems to be the easiest one for me.

I scrolled down through their website. <br>
I thought, "An organization that lint codes in different languages? Interesting."

At first, I wasn't so sure about my decision, but I have no regrets choosing coala.
