<div style="font-size: 35px">Why did I choose coala as the organization?</div>

I planned to choose Zulip this year. But I couldn't find the organization in GCI 2018's organization list.
I was sad.<br>
So I scrolled down the organizations list, looking for one with the python tag.

There were a lot of organizations that uses python, but coala seems to be the easiest one for me.
