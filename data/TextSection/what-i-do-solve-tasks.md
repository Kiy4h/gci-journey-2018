<div style="font-size: 35px">What I do when I was solving tasks</div>

I usually read the documentation(s) that involves my current task and see others' submissions if there are any.

When I was waiting for a review on my current task, I usually do a research on a task I haven't claimed that I planned<br>
to do next, so I won't waste my time waiting for a mentor.

It saves my time.
