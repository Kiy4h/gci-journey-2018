<div style="font-size: 35px">Task Statistics</div>

Google Code-In was opened at 26th October. I claimed my first task a week late, at 1st November.

Here's a graph showing the total of tasks I've finished from 1st November to 10th December:

<div style="width: 60%; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19); text-align: center; display: inline-block">

<div style="padding: 10px; font-size: 17px">

</div>
</div>

I've solved a total of 20 tasks. (not counting the blog task yet)

As you can see, I have finished 13 tasks from 1st November to 10th November.

But in 11th November to 17th November, I didn't solve any tasks. <br>
That was when I didn't know which task I should solve. I claimed around 3 tasks and abandoned them in the end.

Then, at 18th November, I decided to claim <a href="/task-10">a design task</a> to motivate myself that I can still solve tasks. <br>
I finished two more design tasks at Nov 19 - Nov 21.

After the design tasks, I claimed <a href="/task-17">a coAST task</a>. That's what took me pretty long. <br>
The task's difficulty is low, but there's *always* some little mistakes in my changes. <br>
In the end, the task was finally approved after 8 days. I felt like, I did it, finally.

In 29th November to 4th December, I didn't have any problems while solving tasks. <br>
But at 5th December, I claimed a bear task, and I was stuck once again.

I asked <a href="https://github.com/ayan-b/">ayan-b</a> for help and I explained the problems I faced. He helped me a lot.

But after a few days, I realized that the problem was the bear itself. I wish I realized that sooner.<br>
The task expired and I claimed the blog task.
