<div class="bigtext">Task Statistics</div>

Google Code-In was opened at 26th October. I claimed my first task a week late, at 1st November.

Here's a graph showing the total of tasks I've finished from 1st November to 12th December (GCI's deadline):

I've solved a total of 22 tasks In GCI 2018.

As you can see, I have finished 13 tasks from 1st November to 10th November. <br>
It was when <a href="https://github.com/jayvdb/">jayvdb</a> review tasks really fast.

But in 11th November to 17th November, I didn't solve any tasks. <br>
That was when I didn't know which task I should solve, I claimed around 3 tasks and abandoned them in the end.

Then, at 18th November, I decided to claim <a href="/task-10">a design task</a> to motivate myself that I can still solve tasks. <br>
I finished two more design tasks at Nov 19 - Nov 21.

After the design tasks, I claimed <a href="/task-17">a coAST task</a>. That's what took me pretty long. <br>
The task's difficulty is low, but there's *always* some little mistakes in my changes. <br>
In the end, the task was finally approved after **8 days**. I felt like, I did it.

In 29th November to 4th December, I didn't have any problems while solving tasks. <br>
But at 5th December, I claimed a bear task and I was stuck once again.

I asked <a href="https://github.com/ayan-b/">ayan-b</a> for help and I explained the problems I faced. He helped me a lot.

But after a few days, I realized that the problem was the bear itself. I wish I realized that sooner.<br>
The task expired and I claimed the blog task right after that.

<div class="bigtext">Blog Task</div>

The blog task was really fun. <br>
I felt like I can do better, but there are not much time.<br>
But I'd say, I'm proud of it.

And I'd like thank <a href="https://github.com/ayan-b/">ayan-b</a> once again for helping me with this task.<br>
I finished the blog task a few hours before the claiming task deadline arrived.

<div class="bigtext">Final Task</div>

Then I claimed the <a href="/task-22">Roll your own task</a> task.<br>
It took me a while to choose the final task.
But I finally found [an issue with a medium difficulty](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/1922).

The issue is to make the StyleLintBear configurable.<br>
I was like, "okay, that must be easy"

Then I saw that the StyleLintBear has **94 arguments** (if I didn't forget).<br>
So I thought, "This task isn't going to be *that* difficult, but it will take some time"

At first, I was manually doing it.<br>
But then I got an idea, "Why don't I save my time by making a small python script that generates the docstrings and the tests?"

In the end, I did it. I finished the task in around 5 hours, which is about 7 hours before the deadline.
