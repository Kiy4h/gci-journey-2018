<div style="font-size: 35px">Prior Experience</div>

I participated GCI last year in an organization called Zulip.

Why did I choose Zulip? Because the organization uses python, and python is the only programming language I'm good at.

I was a newcomer. I didn't know much about git at that time, but it didn't take long to get used to it.<br>
It was fun. I solved 13 tasks.

When GCI 2017 has ended, I have dreamt to join GCI 2018, which now I did.
It is a good coincidence that coala uses Zulip, so I don't confuse with the layout.
