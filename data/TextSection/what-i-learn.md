<div style="font-size: 35px">What I learned from GCI</div>

I've learned a bit of yaml files, how they work and how you process them.

I've learned how to sync a fork, use a virtual environment, and sync moban. <br>
Commands are easy to remember when you use them frequently, but they are easily forgotten when you stopped using them.

I've learned that I should never commit and push before running "<tt>coala</tt>", or else the bot will *spam* you. <br>
This has happened to me many times, almost everytime I pushed. The GitMate bot did a great job.

I've learned how to make a website with statik and deploying them to netlify. <br>
Making this website isn't as hard as you think.

<s>Lastly, I've learned that sleeping is important.</s> <br>
I have enough sleep today.
